I: Welcome to ImperiumAO!|Welcome to the magical and fantastic ImperiumAO’s lands! This short tutorial will help you getting started within the game with the strength and confidence of a brave adventurer. At the end of this tutorial you will be able to fully explore the game and live adventures like never before. ImperiumAO is an RPG and fighting game: teamwork, companionship and personal dexterity are vital characteristics to achieve success in this world. Good luck! You can now begin the tutorial.|0|0|tutorial_1.bmp
II: Controls|The different kind of actions in the game are made with this two basic options: you can either move with the arrows or with the WASD keys. It depends on the choice of the user. You also have the option to change the basic and movement controls as you like. To do this, you have to go to the “Menu” button (at the right edge of the screen) then click "Options" and look for the option "Cuztomise controls".\n\nImperiumAO brings you the possibility of using Hotkeys. The Hotkeys are a facility that incorporates the client to repeat or perform repetitive actions. This can be used with the keyboard or with the mouse. A Hotkey can send a command (for example "/meditate"), equip or use an item, or cast a spell.\n\nRemember that actions in the game can also be performed with the mouse, either with the left click, right click or with the mouse wheel. Like the keys, you can vary the actions you want to perform with each mouse button, either walk, interact with an NPC or cast a spell.|O|O|tutorial_2.bmp
III: The World| ImperiumAO is a wide magic and fantasy world in which you can travel and discover. All players will have a world guide map, which can be accessed ingame by clicking the globe in the interface. In the map, you can either see your current location (represented by red dot), or see your guild and teammates location (represented by a blue triangle). Each part of the world is made of maps; that have different numbers to make them easy to distinguish. Also, you will be able to see all the creatures that are located in each region of the world. With this tool, you will be able to go either to the Dungeons or to the cities, charting your own way.\nThere are two big dominant cities: The first one is Banderbill which is the Empire’s capital and the headquarters of the Sacred Order. On the other hand, we have Suramei, which is again dominated by the Republic, and the Inmortal Legion’s home. The Ruins of Orac are the way to hell, an underground city that belongs to the Chaos Forces and it is ruled by them.\n\nHowever, there are also cities that are called “Neutral”; like Lindos, Nueva Esperanza, Tiama, Arghal, Rinkel, Ullathorpe, Nix and Illiandor.|0|0|tutorial_3.bmp
IV: Dungeons|The frequently called dungeons are caves where powerful creatures live. These places are frequented by people who either look for training or for fighting with enemies. You’ll find NPCs that can only be found in that specific dungeon, and that will either give you gold, items, or experience that will increase your level. You will be able to find mineral deposits there too.\n\n As these places are so desired, the entrance usually has a level restriction, with the purpose of achieving a good balance inside them.\nYou can find these places all throughout the world of ImperiumAO, but beware, all of them are found on insecure areas and other players could attack you in your way.|0|0|tutorial_4.bmp
V: Creatures|In the lands of ImperiumAO there are thousands of creatures. The great majority of them are hostile and will try to attack you constantly. Each creature has certain amounts of health points, which lets us calculate if we are capable of facing it or not. At the same time, when killing the creature, this will give a certain amount of gold and experience points. The experience points the creature gives us will get us closer to leveling up and the gold, will make us richer.\n\nEvery creature has different qualities. Some of them are immune to spells that immobilize the target, other ones are able to detect invisibility spells. However, there are three different groups which share the same characteristic: aquatic creatures, magical creatures and poisoning creatures. The aquatic creatures are those that can only move on water, like mermaids or leviathans. The poisoning ones can poison you with their attacks, like snakes, scorpions, spiders or medusas. Finally, the magical creatures attack with long distance spells or direct attacks and spells at the same time.|0|0|tutorial_5.bmp
VI: Items|A vast number of items exist in the world of ImperiumAO, each with a different trait. They can be classified in Trade Items, Profession Items, Drop Items and Shop Items.\n\Trade Items are those that can be obtained by interacting with a Merchant NPC in any city of the world. These are weapons, robes, hats, shields, helmets, potions, scrolls, food, and even rings that allow you to cast more spells.\nProfession Items are those that are obtained by performing the profession that you chose for your character (smithy, tailoring, alchemy or carpentry). To craft them, you must gather the resources that they require and make sure you have the skill points that its creation demands.\nDrop Items are the ones we obtain by killing a hostile creature, such as goblins, wolves, medusas or dragons. The mighty creatures drop valuable items such as orbs, hats, and staffs while weak creatures drop items of less value such as rings or magic rods, useful to low level players.\n\nShop Items can be bought in the ImperiumAO official website using credits, they go from crowns to gems that can be used to join a faction. As opposed to most items mentioned, you do not drop them when you die.\n\nAlso, there are the so-called Unique Items, they are very valuable and are only granted by Administrators as rewards in special events.|0|0|tutorial_6.bmp
VII: NPCs|Through the vast continent of ImperiumAO you will find different types of NPCs (Non-player Characters), with whom you may interact peacefully or aggressively. One of them are the Merchants. They live in cities and are peaceful. They will offer you all kind of merchandise in return for gold coins. They sell things like: weapons and defense equipment; Spells and potions; Manuals and work tools; Food, water, and even saddles. You will also find an NPC that acts as a banker, who will help you keep objects and gold safe or transfer gold between characters.\n\nThere are also Factional NPCs, and just as Merchants you will find them in cities or in specific places. They are peaceful toward members of their faction, but if you either belong to an enemy faction or break the rules they will be forced to attack you. You can tell them apart from neutral NPCs by the colours they wear, as they will always dress according to their alignment. They may offer you to join their side, by talking to the leader of each army.\n\nFinally, there are Quest Givers. They will ask you to do something for them, and will offer a reward in return. You will find them scattered randomly across the world.|0|0|tutorial_7.bmp
VIII: Players|Combat is a very important part when you play ImperiumAO. It can happen when you explore unsecure maps, when you invade enemy cities, when you challenge an opponent to a duel or even in the Combat Arenas. But it can not be done in neutral cities as: Ullathorpe, Lindos, Nix, Illiandor, Arghal and Tiama.\n\n In the three factional cities, there can be a fight between members of different factions. These are Banderbill (Empire), Suramei (Republic) and Infierno (Chaos Forces)\n\nRemember, when you go to an insecure zone (outside of a city) you are putting your life in danger, ImperiumAO can be a very hostile world.|0|0|tutorial_8.bmp
IX: Life and Death|Death in the land of ImperiumAO can be caused by hostile NPCs/Creatures or by other users. But even if you die the game does not end and you can choose between three options, which they are going to bring you back to life.\n\n• When selecting “Accept” this will send us to the closest temple where the priest will revive us. If we choose “Decline” we will see ourselves as a ghost, we will be able to wander around freely, with the exception of not being able to attack or be attacked, nor picking items up. (In case of choosing “Decline” by mistake, when using the rune, it will send us to the temple and we will revive again).\n\n• If we don´t press “Accept”, an ally/partner of our same Faction can cast the spell “Resurrect” on us.\n\n• If we own the item “Rykan Necklace”, it will automatically revive us, but at the same time it will fall from our inventory.|0|0|tutorial_9.bmp
X: Jobs|In the world of ImperiumAO your character can learn jobs for the obtainment of resources and their utilization. Fishing is a job than anyone can employ and it is used because the fish has a high selling price in the market. The other jobs are:\n\n• Mining and Blacksmithing.\n• Wood and Carpentry.\n• Tailoring.\n• Chemistry and Botany.\n\n These jobs require a manual to carry them out, and characters can only carry out one job at the time. Jobs can be switched at any moment, but sacrificing the skill points already earned on the previous job. These manuals can be bought in the store that corresponds to each job. By having more skill points in the job you choose, you will be able to obtain a bigger quantity of resources and to make more valuable objects!\nIf you want to know in detail the items that you could create, visit the links below:\n\n• Wood and Carpentry:http://wiki.imperiumao.com.ar/carpentry.\n• Tailoring: http://wiki.imperiumao.com.ar/tailoring.\n• Mining and Blacksmithing: http://wiki.imperiumao.com.ar/mining_and_blacksmithing_.\n• Botany and Chemistry: http://wiki.imperiumao.com.ar/botany.|0|0|tutorial_10.bmp
XI: Spells|Spells are incantations that consume mana and/or energy. You can identify three types of spells: damage, healing, and those who affect the player’s stats in a positive or negative way. \n\n To cast a spell, you have to select from the “Spell” button or from the different hotkeys and then click on the target. This target can be your character, the character of another player (ally or enemy) or a creature.\n\n You can buy this spells in: Rinkel (for any faction), Banderbill (Imperials and Sacred Order members only) and Suramei (Republicans and Inmortal Legion members only).|0|0|tutorial_11.bmp
XII: Travel|If you enter to the world of ImperiumAO you will discover different types of means of transport to travel faster.\n The teleports are portals that transfer you to another place and they are identified for being a blue or a green flame. There is also a passage called “Intermundia” that is casted by wizards or necromancers and gives you the access to any city.\n\n The saddles may be different between classes but their function will be the same, to give more movement speed and it can be bought with the horse seller located at Ullathorpe. You must also get the horse-riding manual, which can be obtained in the same place.\n\n The extensive oceans of the world are navigated by Boats, Galleys or Galleons. They can be built with a certain amount of wood produced by lumberjacks and the skills of a carpenter. Another alternative is travelling in the captain’s ships, which are situated in the ports of each city. For both, manuals of navigation are needed and they are provided by the carpenters NPCs. |0|0|tutorial_12.bmp
XIII: Friend List|The friend list serves to know if the other person is connected. In case that the person who we added is connected, we will be able to find detailed information about his: character in use, alignment (faction), level, class, race, server on which he is connected, and the map in which he is at the moment. There are six actions available (from left to right):\n\n• To modify the nickname or name of the friend in the list.\n• To write a Private Message to a friend.\n• To create a group (very useful when both are at long distances).\n• To Erase a friend.\n• To block out a friend.\n• To add a friend.|0|0|tutorial_13.bmp
XIV: Factions|As the time passes, your skill in combat will get better and great armies will want you to join them. When that time comes, you will be able to choose your own path by joining the faction that fits best in the role you want to play in-game. You can either fight for justice alongside the Imperial soldiers, join the Chaos Forces and spread fear in every region, or be part of the retaliation plans that the resurrected Republic will try to carry out. If you think your role does not fit in any of that, you can remain as a free citizen.\n\nIn order to join a Faction, you must reach out to its respective leader (Cliara Lakhar, Fausto, or Mhorkvel) and right-click them. If you have what it takes, the leader will let you in and your name's color will automatically change to the color associated with the faction. In addition, you'll receive an armour that will differentiate you from the other factions.\nIf you want to earn a bigger position within your army, you must raise the amount of deaths you have caused.\n\nTo know more about ranks and requirements, you can visit the Factions section of our Wiki (http://wiki.imperiumao.com.ar).|0|0|tutorial_14.bmp
XX: Guilds|A guild is a group of players on a same alignment and is identified with a legend under the nickname of each member. Belonging to one has advantages, such as a chat for exclusive use of its members, seeing one another, both on the mini map (with a blue dot) as on the world map (with a blue triangle) and the use of signals of alert or help. Only characters within a faction may belong to a clan and its members can not attack each other, no matter if they belong to the Immortal Legion or the Hordes of Chaos.\n\nTo found a clan is a requirement to be listed in a faction (Sacred Order, Immortal Legion, Hordes of Chaos), own a Leadership Manual, and own the orange, grey, gold and lunar gems in the inventory. Once we accomplish these requirements, we type /foundclan and follow the instructions that are given to us (select a suitable name, establish rules and codes of the same, etc).|0|0|tutorial_15.bmp
XVI: Administrators|The administrators or Dungeon Masters (also called DMs) are in charge of keeping the order, enforcing the rules, attempting to achieve a harmony between users based on respect and good relation within the game. They are distinguished for having a green nickname and the legend <Dungeon Master> below it. Besides of keeping an enjoyable game climax, Dungeon Masters randomly perform various events to entertain the players in a different way, like combat tournaments between users, mazes, etc.\n\nDMs are also in charge of answering questions made by users inside the game, based on what was consulted with the /HELP command. This command can be used to clarify doubts about the game and everything that composes it, report any player who did something out of the regulations, make complains, suggestions or error/bugs reports.|0|0|tutorial_16.bmp
XVII: Underworld|One of the benefits of becoming a donor user is gaining access to the Underworld. This is an additional world, in which the Great Wizard Garveloth is lying. Here you can find numerous creatures that will not be found in other parts of the world and also exclusive Dungeons including the “Black Threshold”, which is the equivalent to Dungeon Newbie. Consider that the only safe areas in Underowlrd are: •South Haven, in which you can find traders, priests and is the destination of many groups of explorers. •Chaotic Ruins, that contain Chaotic guards that will attack you if you are not a Renegade or part of the Chaos Forces. Be careful because you will not find traders in this Chaotic outpost. ¿How to get to Underworld? You can get into it by the Shillian Island, which can be entered by walking into the green portals that can be found in Banderbill and Suramei, or if you own a ship, you can make a trip from Rinkel taking a North direction to the desert and then East, crossing the sea to reach the island. After crossing the portal of the Shillian Island, you will reach the Ruins of the Destination, in which on the South you will find a Priest, a Veterinary and Bankers to deposit or extract your goods. To the West, you will find a portal that will take you to the Chaotic Ruins, to the East a portal that will take you to South Haven and finally, to the Northeast and Northwest portals that will take you to different points of unsafe areas inside the Underworld.|0|0|tutorial_17.bmp
